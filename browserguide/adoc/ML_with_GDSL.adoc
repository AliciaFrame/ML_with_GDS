= ML with GDS

== Overview

1. Prepare data for using an ML model
2. Train graph embeddings as an input for a model
3. Predict missing node labels (in this case, who's an X-Man)
4. Predict missing relationships (who will appear in a future comic book together)
5. Use the trained models to make predictions
